# Tri: the TODO mgmt app

This pet project is really just my own flavour of following [this great workshop](https://spf13.com/presentation/building-an-awesome-cli-app-in-go-oscon/).

I can take no credit for anything built here, used just for practicing building
a sample go CLI app.

## Extra features

- [x] logging with the `log` pkg instead of `fmt`.
- [x] follow up functions
  - [x] filter by priority or done status
